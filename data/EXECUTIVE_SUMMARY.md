---

## CONCLUSION

### Overall Assessment: STABLE BUT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

**Strengths:**
- Excellent data management and tracking
- Strong family financial support system
- Investment mindset despite constraints
- Able to recover from low balance situations
- Digital payment proficiency

**Weaknesses:**
- 100% income dependency on family
- Negative cash flow (Rs. 24,484 deficit)
- No emergency fund buffer
- High food delivery spending
- Irregular income timing

**Outlook:**
With the Rs. 309,000 education expense being a one-time (per semester) event, the underlying daily spending of Rs. 1,283/day is manageable. However, planning for the next semester and establishing self-earned income are critical for long-term financial independence.

**Grade:** B- (Passing, but improvement needed)
