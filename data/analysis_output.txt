9. WHY THE MISMATCH?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The user reported:
  - Monthly spend: ₹3,39,000
  - Monthly income: ₹3,15,000
  - Total balance: ₹41,98,000

Our analysis shows:
  - Actual expenses (Jan 1-24): ₹339,794.46
  - Actual income (Jan 1-24): ₹315,310.45
  - Current balance (Jan 24): ₹41,816.55

EXPLANATION:
1. PARTIAL MONTH: This is only Jan 1-24, not a full month
2. BALANCE ≠ INCOME - EXPENSES: The total balance (₹41,98,000) is NOT calculated
   as income minus expenses. It's the RUNNING BALANCE in the account.
3. STARTING POSITION: The user started with ₹66,300.56 before the first transaction
   on Jan 1. This is money from BEFORE this period.
4. CORRECT CALCULATION:
   - Starting Balance + Income - Expenses = Ending Balance
   - ₹66,300.56 + ₹315,310.45 - ₹339,794.46 = ₹41,816.55

The reported numbers might be:
- User interface showing projected full month values
- Including pending transactions not yet imported
- Showing different date ranges
- Including multiple accounts combined
